2009.02.25<br />
Well, sometimes your life can get caught up in many things, and you don't have time for updating your website.  But now as I look across much of my website, I see a ton of things that can be improved, and maybe the time away helped in recognizing them.<br />
This update is somewhat brief because I just wanted to show that I'm still working on things, and I think that I should really start making updates more frequently instead of doing them in large chunks.  Hopefully I'll make several updates in a relatively short period of time.<br />
* Copyright years updated.<br />
* Material & Decoration - Wood and (especially) Finishing subsections massively overhauled (section will probably need splitting soon); Acrylic subsection renamed Acrylic Glass and Polycarbonate; Metal subsection updated and reorganized to a lesser extent; Imagery subsection distinguished and embellished.<br />
* Brand Controllers - Madcatz added and Hori updated.
</p>

<p>
2008.10.31<br />
I finished the other very small controller; it is interesting to play with it.  I still have another seven controllers to complete in mind, most of the started already.<br />
* Summarized Examples - Contents index added; Snuff Box added.<br />
* Brand Controllers - TMO Gaming moved and replaced with Norris Arcade Sticks.
</p>

<p>
2008.10.27<br />
I got another controller done and added; I should have another up very quickly.  I messed with PCBs, metal, and finishes a bit more and refined their information among others a little more.  I also added a contents index to some of the longer sections.<br />
* Attributes & Brands - Contents index added.<br />
* Tools - Contents index added; new screws, bolts, nuts, and washers image with some more description added; more drill bits described and fuller image added; Utility Knife added; Dremel changed to Rotary Tool; mention of using a router for planing added; Jigs and Fixtures renamed to Jigs and Fixtures and Templates with more information added.<br />

2008.09.24<br />
With this update the site has become much more refined and versatile.  I made the numbers in the joystick and button charts very exact.  There is much more information on using different tools, centering layouts, sizing panels and boxes, mounting devices, tweaking PCBs, using multiple PCBs, lighting devices, and working with metal.  The site is now much less centered on using wood.  I actually now feel that using metal for the control panel is much better than using wood.<br />
I think at this point I've hit a threshold on specialized information, which I may have already gone too far past, so, beyond somethings like device models and controller builds, I do not want to expand many aspects of the information contained in this site beyond where it is now.  I will definitely look to refine things fitting the type of information already present though.  Mainly I think the sections and subsections in place now are fairly adequate.<br />
The main to-do's on my list include controllers (of which like five very different ones are about half way completed; I have nine total more planned for the examples section) and new joystick and button models.<br />
* HTML code updated so that subsections can be linked by adding "#SUBSECTION_NAME" to the end of the address, example "pcb_wiring.html#PCB_DIAGRAMS".<br />
* Basic Parts - Mention that wire also makes up the cord added.<br />
* Attributes & Brands - Mention of Korean joystick companies in opening; Freedom of Movement subsection renamed Tension; note that some measurements may contradict official diagrams added; measurements in joysticks and buttons charts strongly rechecked for accuracy using detailed instruments; Gates Quality in joystick chart changed to Deflection; Sanwa and Seimitsu mounting plate thickness noted more precisely; main point for different joysticks for different games emphasized; button diameters changed to actual diameter measurements as opposed to hole measurements.<br />
* Layout - Capcom US layout modified to better resemble official design; Centering Your Layout and Sizing Your Panel subsection added.<br />
* Tools - More general descriptions not centering so much on wood; much more information on using the table saw and drill press added; mention of the radial arm saw added; Standard Drill Bits and Drill Hole Bits subsections consolidated to Drill Bits subsection with more information given to various types of bits; router transitioning images added; note on router bit shank sizes added; Tape added; Planer added; D-Sub Connector subsection renamed D-Sub/USB Connector with more information; desoldering braid noted as better than pumps; better wire cutters and desoldering tools images added; Jigs subsection renamed to Jigs and Fixtures and image added; Printer subsection added.<br />
* Mounting & Layering - Panel Guideline Measurements subsection overhauled; image of mounting plates added; Mounting subsection renamed to Mounting Types; some notes added to the different mounting designs; Mounting Plate Modification and Device Mounting subsections added.<br />
* Box - More description given to the most common box design; surrounded solid box design added; combined subsection split to Box Slanting and Front Enhancement and Side Buttons subsections and expanded; Box Thickness subsection added.<br />
* PCB & Wiring - PCB Attributes subsection split to PCB Components Modification and Removal subsections with a lot more advanced information added; solderless subsection updated; note added about soldering terminals; a little more information on terminals added; joystick connection subsection modified in reference to commons; note that X-Arcade PCB lags a lot added; Multiple PCBs subsection added.<br />
* Material & Decoration - Some notes on working acrylic added; Metal subsection added; finish testing image added; notes about oil-based and water-based products added; Illumination subsection added.<br />
* Example Ingredients - Section modified to include both a list of my favorite ingredients in one subsection and purchases in the other; several example purchases added.<br />
* Detailed Example - Dimensions of controller pieces also now listed in centimeters.<br />
* Summarized Examples - Dimensions of controller pieces also now listed in centimeters.<br />
* Brand Controllers - Mayflash added.<br />
* References - TaeYoung, Woodcraft, Rockler, Electronics123, and McMaster-Carr links added.

Wow, almost two months without an update.  Where did the time go?<br />
Anyways, I got a controller done for once, and some experience with several other things along with it.  The highlights of this quick update include an update for the buttons subsection and chart, the Vewlix layout, a huge boost of my PCB diagrams total up to 43, and of course the documentation for my newest controller build.  But I still have an enormous detailed list of to-do's which will update numerous things, hopefully within the next couple weeks or so.  And I have a couple controllers about half way done, with another five planned out.<br />
* Attributes & Brands - Switches variety image added and other button images moved around; description of long switches added; buttons Engage and Throw Distance subsection added; Plunger Shape in buttons chart replaced with Engage Distance; more button modding options noted; note about mixing Seimitsu clear, tinted, and pearl plunger faces added; detailed description of Seimitsu long switch mod added.<br />
* Layout - Joystick points changed to center on actual points for Hori and Sega layouts; Stant added; Vewlix precise diagram added (thanks to TheRealNeoGeo).
* Tools - Standard and hole bits images consolidated to a better image showing the variety of bits; better image of wire used.<br />
* PCB & Wiring - 15 new PCB diagrams added; PCB dimensions added to each diagram image; better PS1 Dual Shock A early version diagram used; some more information on how grounds work in the images added.

2008.07.05<br />
This is a pretty big update.  It centers on refining the buttons subsection, tools section, finishing subsection, and brand controllers section, as well as, again, more general refinement.  It is an attempt to get things to where I'm more comfortable working on an actual controller than polishing this site.<br />
Bleh, I noticed and fixed quite a few typo's left from the last five or so updates and I apologize for them.<br />
My to-do list has gotten cut down quite a bit.  Right now it mainly consists of controller builds, a few PCB items (I want to try them first), illuminating joysticks and buttons (I want to try them first), some buttons I need to test, a few images, and some special stuff I'll reveal after I have done a couple controller builds.  So really the site is getting to a relatively level position.  Again, if you have suggestions, don't hesitate to give them; I have received almost none.<br />

The layout section has been strongly refined and expanded.  I invested a lot of time in measuring, studying, and understanding various standard layouts.  I also got a new photo editing program so I could make many images throughout the site look much better, especially the PCB diagrams which looked like they were labeled with crayon before.<br />
It's funny how these refinements of my site keep delaying my work on controllers...<br />

2008.06.03<br />
I felt my PCB and Wiring section lacked some information, so I went on a tangent and worked on getting that section reorganized and expanded to my liking.  I added more information on the electronics of PCBs and now have a total of 27 PCB diagrams and counting, as well as a lot of other various information.  Some other sections got some smaller updates that are noted below.  I also noticed how I could edit some of the images to look better, so that will probably also be in the next update.  Now I really need to get a couple controllers done too.<br />

I made a post about this site on the Shoryuken forums, and it got a nice response, thanks to the users there.  I mainly tweaked a lot of things (a few of which were suggested in the post), but also came of up some new ideas.  I have some ideas now how to make a panel that can support a variety of non-standard joysticks.  I have not started on any new joysticks yet, but hopefully will have some time soon.  I also still have a list of many to-do's for the future.<br />

I finished making a joystick controller and made a detailed step-by-step of how it went, and then quickly made another.  I decided the 1 section will stay as example ingredients, the 2 section will be a detailed example of this controller I just made, and the 3 section will be more summarized examples of joystick builds.  I have a few ideas for joysticks a lot different from the two I made so far.<br />
With many additions and changes, the site is about where it needs to be now.  I think in the future updates will be a lot more detailed about changes since a lot fewer will occur.  With only about 200 hits for this page so far, I need to try to get some notice for this site.<br />
* Some text through-out tweaked.<br />
* A few large pictures added throughout.<br />
* Joystick Brand Parts - chart of joystick attributes added.<br />
* Joystick Brand Parts - more models added.<br />
* Tools - some more tools added.<br />
* Mounting - more detailed and accurate measurements.<br />
* Mounting - mention of arcade panels.<br />
* Material - more details about wood and finishing.<br />
* Example Ingredients - some purchases added.<br />
* Example Detailed Controller Build added.<br />
* Example Summarized Controller Build added (with more to come).<br />
* Example Summarized Controller Build - The Idiot Box added.<br />
* Brand Controllers - the HRAP mentioned.<br />
* Links - a couple more links added.<br />
Some lingering to-do's:<br />
* At least four summarized controller builds.<br />
* Maybe a brief description for how to illuminate buttons and joysticks (which I currently do not know how to do).<br />
* More brand arcade controllers.
</p>

I got around to soldering PCBs for the first time.  Managed to ruin a couple cheap ones in the process.  The PCB and Wiring section turned out to be much longer than I expected it would be.  But decently comprehensive explanations of PCB extracted soldering are hard to find.  Also got an example ingredients section started.  The 123 sections may still be rethought.  Still need to make and document making a new arcade controller.<br />
* Photos of larger objects taken.<br />
* Many photos retaken for better quality.<br />
* Joystick Brand Parts - images of some models of joysticks added.<br />
* Tools - stronger note on practicing using tools or techniques first.<br />
* Tools - some more tools added.<br />
* Mounting - mention of depth variation in Sanwa and Seimitsu models of joysticks.<br />
* Mounting - better explanation of the utility of the S-plate.<br />
* Mounting - couple new S-plate designs.<br />
* Material - note on availabilities of and strange measurement standards for wood.<br />
* Material - elaboration on acrylic glass.<br />
* PCB and Wiring - section better completed, especially in regards to extracted PCBs.<br />
* Example Ingredients - section started.

Well, I've been working on this page using spare time for the past couple months.  Took WAY longer than I thought it would.  Time to launch it.<br />
It's not anywhere near finished.  (Can it ever even be finished?)  But it can be used very practically at this point.<br />
About all the general information I have for the time being has been written up for this document.<br />
Most the pictures and diagrams have been made, including diagrams of restrictors/activators, layouts, panels, boxes, and many other things, and including pictures of instructions, joysticks, buttons, and a ton of other ingredients, and navigation images.<br />
Some early to-do's:<br />
* Finally getting to put together a new controller and images of doing it.<br />
* Getting the examples for and maybe reassessing the 123 sections.<br />
* Some actual first-hand soldering and images of doing it.<br />
* A few stray photos of larger objects and models of joysticks.<br />
* Some new-found errors that will inevitably exist.<br />
And as things go, there will be new techniques, ideas, products, knowledge, etc that will come along and add to this page.
